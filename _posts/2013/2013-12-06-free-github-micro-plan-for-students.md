[GitHub][1] is a great service that I use often to host my personal projects. Their free accounts offer an unlimited number of public repositories where your code is visible to anyone visiting your profile. This is great for any open source work, but not so good for coursework projects where you really want to keep your source code private (at least until the deadline).

Handily though, if you are a student GitHub will give you a free Micro plan for a few years to help in your studies. This plan comes with 5 private repositories and of course you are still able to create an unlimited number of public ones.

All you need is a valid academic email address that has been added to your GitHub and you are good to go.
