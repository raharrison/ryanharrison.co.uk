A beta version of Visual Studio 11 has been released alongside the beta of .NET 4.5.

In Visual Studio 11 the whole interface has been transformed to a monochrome effect that is a lot more pleasing to the eye for long periods than previous versions which barraged the user with layers of colourful and distracting icons.

With the code view open, the main focus is rightly where it should be – on the code. Nothing else is stealing your attention.

Some of the new features including Hubs, Pivots and multi – instancing are explained in the [Visual Studio Blog][2].
