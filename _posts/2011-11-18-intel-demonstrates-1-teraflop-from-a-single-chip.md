Intel has recently showcased the new &#8216;Knights Ferry&#8217; processor at a supercomputing conference in Seattle. The new chip was demonstrated running in a test machine and is capable of crossing the 1 teraflop mark, or a trillion floating point operations barrier &#8211; something previously restricted to tens of cabinets filled with processors.

To put that into perspective, Intel unveiled the first supercomputer to cross the 1 teraflop mark in 1997. That system was comprised of 9,298 Pentium II processors that filled 72 full-sized cabinets. In comparison, the new 22nm processor, called &#8216;Knights Ferry&#8217;, is about the size of a matchbook and can achieve the same level of performance.

Don&#8217;t expect to see these new chips anywhere anytime soon however.  Intel and its partners hope to deliver said systems by 2018.
