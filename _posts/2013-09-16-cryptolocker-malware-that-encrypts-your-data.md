So apparently there is a new bit of malware going around now which is particularly nasty. It encrypts all of the data on your drive and mapped network drives with an RSA 256 bit AES key. Once encrypted there is obviously no way to decrypt it again. The only way to get the files back is from an off site backup (because if the backup drive is local it also gets encrypted) or to pay them their ransom which would of course decrypt your files (not).Â The fact that this also attacks networked drives is particularly annoying and I bet this would catch a lot of people out if they were to get infected.
