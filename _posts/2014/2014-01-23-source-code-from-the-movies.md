It happens all so often nowadays in movies -; an extremely smart character writes some really complex bit of code that nobody else can understand in order to hack into some system or otherwise perform some other complicated task.

Quite often we get a good look at the code they are using -; which often looks very obfuscated -; and we just accept it for what it is. But now someone has taken the time to figure out where the code they use in films and TV shows actually comes from. As it turns out the code they are actually use isn't all that complicate at all -; and in most cases isn't at all related to the task in hand.
